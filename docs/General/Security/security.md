## :octicons-question-16: Why do I have to worry about Account Security?

**Reborn takes responsibility to provide systems**, rules that offer as much protection to our players as possible. However, **this responsibility ends on the system end** - we cannot and are not responsible for how players act in-game and out-of-game. 

L2Reborn provided lock systems, master accounts, anti-scam policy, 2FA, server rules and frequently remind players to be careful when trading and to keep their accounts private. 

Your account is your **responsibility**.

!!! danger "Critical Security Tip"
    Never share your password, even with staff members.

!!! tip
    === ":material-alert: Password Tips"
        - **Use random combinations** (@!?#-.,*/- , numbers and capital letters)
        - **Never reuse passwords.**
        - **Enable 2FA.**

    === ":material-eye-check: Spot"
        - **Sharing Accounts** (even with friends or STAFF)
        - **Clicking suspicious links** (e.g. free gift sites, I dare you to click this link)
        - **Downloading "cheats" or unverified programs.**

    === ":material-exclamation: **Avoid**"
        - **Staff impersonators** (check GM USERNAMES and not NICKS)
        - **Urgent threats** (Act now or lose your account!).
        - **Too good to be true links/offers** (Free giftcards / adena links)

!!! info
    ## :material-lock: Lock System
    === ":octicons-code-16: Set Lock Pin"
        `.setlockpw pincode` will set pin code to lock and unlock your character.

    === ":fontawesome-solid-toggle-on: Lock"
        `.lock pincode` enables protection

    === ":fontawesome-solid-toggle-off: Unlock"
        `.unlock pincode` disables protection

When a character is locked these functions are **disabled:**

- trade, destroy, crystalize, enchant skills, put or remove augments, put or remove SA, place private store, use private store, manage clan, manage warehouse, sell to NPC

We recommend you to store Adena and AA in your warehouse and only have in your char the basic/necessary amount.

## :simple-2fas: 2FA


You can enable 2FA here: [l2reborn.org/setting](https://l2reborn.org/setting/). 

Follow the instructions in the window carefully.

!!! question "What is 2FA?"

    When a user tries to log into your master account it will require a code from your mobile authenticator app. The code is re-generated every 30-60s.

    It is highly recommended, you take the first step in securing your account better.
