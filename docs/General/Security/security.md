# User Safety
## Server Rules
You can read about rules here: [l2reborn.org/server-rules](https://l2reborn.org/server-rules/)

## Why do I have to worry about this?
Reborn takes responsibility to provide systems, rules that offer as much protection to our players as possible. However, this responsibility ends on the system end - we cannot and are not responsible for how players act in-game and out-of-game. 

L2Reborn provided lock systems, master accounts, anti-scam policy, 2FA, server rules and frequently remind players to be careful when trading and to keep their accounts private. 

Your account is your **responsibility**. REBORN STAFF will NEVER ask for your password.

:warning: Password Tips:

- Use random combinations (`@!?#-.,*/- , numbers and capital letters`)
- Never reuse passwords.
- Enable 2FA.

:warning: Avoid:

- Sharing Accounts (`even with friends or STAFF`)
- Clicking suspicious links (`e.g. free gift sites, I dare you to click this link`)
- Downloading "cheats" or unverified programs.

:warning: Spot:

- Staff impersonators (`check GM USERNAMES and not NICKS`)
- Urgent threats (`Act now or lose your account!`).
- Too good to be true links/offers (`Free giftcards / adena links`)

**Summary:**

- You are the first line of defense.
- No one, not friends or staff, needs your password.
- Stay skeptical, if something feels off, it probably is.

## Lock System

`.setlockpw pincode` will set pin code to lock and unlock your character. <br>
`.lock pincode` will enable the lock system. <br>
`.unlock pincode` will disable the lock system.

When a character is locked these functions are **disabled:**

- trade, destroy, crystalize, enchant skills, put or remove augments, put or remove SA, place private store, use private store, manage clan, manage warehouse, sell to NPC

We recommend you to store Adena and AA in your warehouse and only have in your char the basic/necessary amount.

### Resetting In-Game Lock PIN
You need to have 2FA, otherwise you can't do it. Enable it here: [l2reborn.org/setting](https://l2reborn.org/setting/)

Go to: [l2reborn.org/game-account](https://l2reborn.org/game-account/) and click on "Overview" for the account you want to unlock.

Click the `â€¦` and click 'Unlock'

## 2FA
![Mobile Authenticator](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Aegis_Authenticator_3.2_screenshot.png){ align=right width="150" }

You can enable 2FA here: [l2reborn.org/setting](https://l2reborn.org/setting/). 

Follow the instructions in the window carefully.

### What is 2FA?

When a user tries to log into your master account it will require a code from your mobile authenticator app. The code is re-generated every 30-60s.

It is highly recommended, you take the first step in securing your account better.

## Anti-Scam Policy

### Reporting Scams

All scam cases **can be reported**, and the staff will take action by **banning the scammer**.

### Scam Information

Only accounts and characters with **2FA** and `.lock` enabled will receive details about the scammer (`character names`).

### Item Recovery

Scam cases involving valuable items (`epic jewels, top-grade items, etc.`) are eligible for item recovery only if **2FA** and `.lock` were enabled at the time of the scam.

We believe these measures are fair and reasonable. 

Spending a few minutes securing your account ensures full protection in case of a scam, allowing you to play with safety and peace of mind while taking responsibility for your account's security.
