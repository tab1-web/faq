# How to report dualbox / bot?

# Report Dual-box/Bot

1. Target the player, in `ALT + C` select **"Auto Hunting Report"** (If available)
2. **Send a private message** to [@ginreborn](<https://discord.com/users/917729115770073119>) or [@astarothreborn](<https://discord.com/users/1067169953683349577>) during EU day time and [@serielreborn](<https://discord.com/users/1139948642166394920>) late EU prime time on discord usually, include **nicknames** and **server name**.
    ```
    Hello! "Thomas and "Charles might be dualboxing on Main Eternal. 
    ```
- If they don't respond, **open a ticket** here: [l2reborn.org/support](https://l2reborn.org/support/)
    - Give necessary information like time-frame, time-zone, server name and nicknames. 
You can upload images via [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) and videos via [streamable.com](https://streamable.com/) to include them **in the ticket with public URL**.

**Do not alert suspects** by letting them know or writing in the discord about them, you will sabotage the investigation.

Auto Hunting Report is **not a live report**, it sends the report to database for checking it out later.
