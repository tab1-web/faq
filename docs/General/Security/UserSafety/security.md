## :octicons-question-16: Why do I have to worry about Account Security?

**Reborn takes responsibility to provide systems**, rules that offer as much protection to our players as possible. However, **this responsibility ends on the system end** - we cannot and are not responsible for how players act in-game and out-of-game. 

L2Reborn provided lock systems, master accounts, anti-scam policy, 2FA, server rules and frequently remind players to be careful when trading and to keep their accounts private. 

Your account is your **responsibility**.

!!! danger "Critical Security Tip"
    Never share your password, even with staff members.
