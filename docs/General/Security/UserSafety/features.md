    ## :material-lock: Lock System
    === ":octicons-code-16: Set Lock Pin"
        `.setlockpw pincode` will set pin code to lock and unlock your character.

    === ":fontawesome-solid-toggle-on: Lock"
        `.lock pincode` enables protection

    === ":fontawesome-solid-toggle-off: Unlock"
        `.unlock pincode` disables protection

When a character is locked these functions are **disabled:**

- trade, destroy, crystalize, enchant skills, put or remove augments, put or remove SA, place private store, use private store, manage clan, manage warehouse, sell to NPC

We recommend you to store Adena and AA in your warehouse and only have in your char the basic/necessary amount.

## :simple-2fas: 2FA


You can enable 2FA here: [l2reborn.org/setting](https://l2reborn.org/setting/). 

Follow the instructions in the window carefully.

!!! question "What is 2FA?"

    When a user tries to log into your master account it will require a code from your mobile authenticator app. The code is re-generated every 30-60s.

    It is highly recommended, you take the first step in securing your account better.
