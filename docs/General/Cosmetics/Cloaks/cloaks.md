To **turn off cloaks**: Go into **Gameplay Settings** and **Do not show cloaks**.

- Cloaks can look narrower on female characters.
- All shown suits work with cloaks at the moment.
- Cloaks might change hairstyle.

Just a heads up:

- Holy Spirit is Green on Robe type armors.

- Wearing a Costume makes it blue on Robe type.

!!! warning
    They are cosmetics only, they do not provide any bonuses.
