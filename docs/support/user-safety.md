## Why do I have to worry about Account Security?

Reborn sets up systems and rules to protect players, but we're not responsible for players' 
actions in or out of the game.


!!! danger "Your account is your responsibility"
    Never share your password or `l2reborn_easylogin.ini` file, even with staff members.
    
    `l2reborn_easylogin.ini` contains all of your passwords. 


<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- ### :simple-2fas: Enable 2FA
    Activate two-factor authentication on the L2Reborn website.    

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Link](https://l2reborn.org/setting/)

- ### :octicons-question-24: About 2FA

    2FA generates a temporary code from your phone when logging into the website.
    
    **Essential** for account security.

- ### :octicons-lock-16: Use the Lock System
    Locked characters can't trade, sell, modify items or PK.

    **Commands**:

    - `.setlockpw pin` - will set pin code to lock & unlock 
    - `.lock pin` - enables protection
    - `.unlock pin` - disables protection


- ### :material-restart: Reset Lock System
    !!! info "Requirements"
        Enable [2FA](https://l2reborn.org/setting) first.
    
    - Visit [Game Accounts](https://l2reborn.org/game-account/)
    - Click `Overview` on the account
    - Click `â‹¯` and **Unlock**

- ### :material-unicorn-variant: Use Unique Passwords
    Use different passwords for different accounts (master, email, servers)

- ### :material-share-off: Never Share Sensitive Information
    Keep your in-game goods and account details private.

!!! warning "Scam Protection"
    - **Report scams** - Staff will ban scammers, but resolve disputes **before** reporting. <br> Banned accounts cannot return lost items. <br> High value items may be returned up to GMs discretion.
    - **2FA + Lock required** to:  
        - See scammer details  
        - Recover lost epic/high-value items  

## Captcha System
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- During gameplay you will encounter Captchas:

    - **"Letter"** captcha (hit 3 letters correct consecutively)
    - **"Anti-bot"** captcha (small math by addition)

    It's **normal** that you encounter them, GMs use these **tools** to uphold **fair play**.

    **Automatic captchas on fail don't ban**, all bans are done manually.

## Summary

- You are the first line of defense.
- No one, not friends or staff, needs your password.
- Stay skeptical, if something feels off, it probably is.
