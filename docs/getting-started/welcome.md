# :material-star: Welcome to Lineage][Reborn!

## :material-mapbox: Adventure Awaits
Reborn is one of the most popular private servers for several versions of Lineage 2 with no pay to win, no wipes and no dual-box. 

It started in 2019 October 31 by a group of enthusiasts with the goal of providing a vanilla and plain experience to bring back childhood memories.

If there's an issue during the Download, try restarting your Router, or use Mobile Data / VPN.

## :material-login: Login

!!! warning
    Make sure to login with your **in-game account's username** and **not your email**.

    Do not share the `l2reborn_easylogin.ini` file with anyone, it contains your passwords.

You don’t have to do fill out your account details every time, use **“Login Easy Manager”** in the bottom right corner.

All the servers you see are essentially proxies that **connect to the same game server**, it's just for better connectivity, 
choose either a Proxy closest to you or the Main server.

- The server is in France.

If you wish to play on the Seasonal Servers, choose from the **[NEW]** servers.

If nothing happens after you pressed **“OK”**, you might have taken too long or the proxy is down. 

- Try another proxy by going into the login menu again.


## :material-sword-cross: You are all set!

It's time to create your character now, I hope you enjoy your your journey. :slight_smile:

Don't forget to **vote**, every server has VIP runes which increases your rates. 

- Free VIP lasts for 12 hours (real-time) and can be acquirable again from the website after the rune expires.
- Bought VIP last longer and may contain cosmetics.
- They increase the rates the same way and don’t stack, but consider supporting the project!
