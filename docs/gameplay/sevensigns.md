# Seven Signs Guide

## Overview
The Seven Seals hold the power of Shilen, the goddess of death. As these seals are opened, the world edges closer to chaos. Two factions compete for control:

- **Revolutionary Army of Dusk**{style="color:lightblue;"} (Dusk)
- **Lords of Dawn**{style="color: #af5d5dff;"} (Dawn)

Players join one of these factions to fight for control over the seals. The event repeats every two weeks, and the winning side can change the server's status.

- ### Winners and Losers
    You can see at the top it says "This is the Seal Validation Period" (Seal Effective Period)

    You cannot register at this time. It needs to be Competition Period.

    The **Dawn Faction**{style="color: #af5d5dff;"} has won, because they got the most points from Seal Stones and Festivals.

    If enough people voted for the Seals, they get to enjoy its' effects.

    **Cabal:** **Dawn**{style="color: #af5d5dff;"}/**Dusk**{style="color:lightblue;"}

- ### Controlling the Seals
    The **Dawn Faction**{style="color: #af5d5dff;"} has 66% of it's players registered to Seal of Avarice. 

    This means if they win, then they can enjoy the effects of Avarice Seal.

    Mostly people see the first option and just click that, but it can happen if not enough people **(10%+ atleast)** vote for Gnosis, 
    then they cannot go to Catacombs during Competition Period.

    Strife is not owned, because not enough people registered to Strife. **(35%+ needs atleast)**
