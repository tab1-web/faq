## Benefits
- By voting you get VIP for **12 hours** (real time) which **increases that character's rates** that you selected.
    - **You can vote again after the 12 hours!**

> Rates are multipliers that **make you level up faster**, **earn more currency** (Adena), and **get better drops** from monsters when you have VIP.

- **Bought VIP** and **VIP** you get from voting **gives the same benefits** and **don't stack** with any VIP.
    - **By buying VIP**: it **lasts longer** and you **support the server!**

- You can vote again using **Mobile Data** or **VPN**
    - This doesn't mean you can dual-box. *See [rules.](https://tab1-web.github.io/faq/support/rules/)*

**How to activate them?**

- **Eternal:** `right click` the item to activate the VIP 
- **Signature:** it's `applied on your character` from inventory (when you see the timer going down), if it's not, try restart the game.

## Eternal Server Rates

> By voting you can access Bonus Buffs in Maria and 2nd stage offers B-Grade items.

> Main has fixed rates: EXP/SP x10 (x7 without VIP), Adena/Drop/Spoil x4.5 (x3 without VIP)
