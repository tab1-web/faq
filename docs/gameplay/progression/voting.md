# Server Rates & Voting Benefits

## Benefits
- Increases your character's rates (applies only to the character you select)
- VIP gives same benefits as voting but lasts longer
- Free and paid VIP don't stack (paid lasts longer)

> Rates are multipliers that make you level up faster, earn more currency (Adena), and get better drops from monsters when you vote or have VIP.

## How It Works
<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- ### Description
    **Vote every 12 hours** to maintain benefits
    
    Voting rune **lasts 12 hours (real time)**
    
    VIP only affects **one character** (the one you select in vote menu)

    **Mobile voting:** You can vote again using mobile data or VPN 
    
    > This doesn't mean you can dual-box. See [rules.](https://tab1-web.github.io/faq/support/rules/)
