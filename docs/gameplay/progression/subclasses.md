## :material-dna: General Info


Subclasses are a major milestone in your character's progression. If you finish the subclass quests,
you're eligible to unlock a new class on the same character that starts from level 40, 
allowing you to switch classes.

Common misconception is that in Interlude chronicles or before, different subclasses can give skills to your Main class, but it's only available from [Hellbound](https://lineage2wiki.org/hellbound/patch-notes/#character_changes) and after

## :fontawesome-solid-scroll: Quests

- Switching/adding classes **removes active buffs, symbol skills and your Sin Eater if it's active**.
- The following information is **retained** between main and subclass:

    - :material-sword-cross: PvP/PK count
    - :material-account-group: Clan and siege info
    - :material-thumb-up: Recommendations and votes
    - :material-account-multiple: Friends and party
    - :material-scale-balance: Seven Signs progress
    - :material-book: Quest progress
    - :material-warehouse: Inventory & Warehouse

!!! note 
    Weight penalties still apply, and you may become **overloaded** after switching classes.

    To switch subclasses, speak to the appropriate Master of that class found in Towns.

    > On **Eternal**{style="color:red;"} you can speak to Maria to switch classes.

## :octicons-sliders-16: Subclass Limits

- Level up a subclass to **75** to unlock one more.
- There’s **no cooldown** or limit on how often you can switch.
- Subclasses are required to unlock:
    - :material-crown: **Noblesse**

## Subclass Selection Interactive Table

Your **main class is the selected one**, the cell turns `grey` if you can't have that subclass. (Restrictions also extend to other Subclasses)

> On **Eternal** the "similar class" restriction only checks against your Main Class. Since Necromancer isn't grouped with the elemental mages, it doesn't block them. This allows Necromancer to take Sorc, Spellh, Spells all at the same time. Though a Sorc main wouldn't be able to do the same.

## Sub to Main Service

- This service is usually announced or sometimes available in `Reborn Shop` in-game for limited time or on the website shop.
- For **Eternal** you can find this Service in Main Server
- Requirements:
    - Your main class must be **between level 75 and 80**
    - The target subclass (future main class) **between level 75 and 80**
    - Main Class is **not Warsmith or Overlord**
    - Character is **not Hero**
    - Elves cannot have Dark Elf subclasses and vice-versa
    - Character's inventory is less than 60 items (quest items excluded).
    - The Subclass and Main Class **do not belong in these same categories** and **you only have 1 sub from targetted category**, such as:
        - Treasure Hunter, Plainswalker and Abyss Walker
        - Hawkeye, Silver Ranger and Phantom Ranger
        - Paladin, Dark Avenger, Temple Knight and Shillien Knight
        - Warlocks, Elemental Summoner and Phantom Summoner
        - Elder and Shillien Elder
        - Swordsinger and Bladedancer
        - Sorcerer, Spellsinger and Spellhowler
    - Note that on **Eternal** if you have a Main Class that don't belong into one of these categories and you choose two or more from the same it will allow you to have these subclasses but it won't allow you to use the **Sub to Main service** as long as you have two or more from the same category. You must delete one of the subclasses in the category there's a friction with. 
        - **For example**: Necromancer can choose Sorcerer, Spellsinger and Spellhowler subs at the same time, however they cannot use the Sub to Main service because they have 3 subclasses from the same category. They would need to delete Spellsinger and Spellhowler to use Sub to Main Service to have Sorcerer as Main.

### Expanding Subclass Slots

- On **Eternal** this is available at Maria for Reborn Coins (Donation).
    - Services > Expand Subclass Slots
- You can have 3 Subclass Slots by retail standards and 5 additional from Expanding Subclass Slots, so you can have 8 Subclasses in total.
- You must level up all of your subclasses to 75 atleast in order to expand subclass slots.
