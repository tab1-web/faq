## **Name Colors & Their Meanings**

| Color | Meaning | Consequences |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Normal (White)**{: style="color:white;"} | Neutral (**non-aggressive**) | No penalties. |
| **Purple**{: style="color:#c154c1;"} | Player has attacked someone, healed or buffed a Purple Name (**aggressor**) | Can be attacked without penalty by others. |
| **Red**{: style="color:red;"} | Player has killed someone (**PKer**) | High-risk status, can drop items |

## **How the System Works**

### Explanation

In Lineage 2, combat is between Player vs Environment, (PVE) or Player vs Player (PvP).

When **attacking** a player while pressing **CTRL**, or **casting good magic** on a monster or a **Purple Player**{style="color: purple;"}, your name becomes **Purple**{style="color: purple;"}, which means they can cast de-buffs on you and kill you without becoming a **Player Killer**{style="color: red;"}.

Most people use **“flagged”**{style="color: purple;"}. instead of **purple naming**{style="color: purple;"}.

### **Drop Penalty**
- When you reach a certain PK count, on death you can drop your items while being **Red**{: style="color:red;"}.
    - On Signature, this is 6.
    - On Eternal, this is 5.


### **Reducing Karma**
- Hunt monsters for experience to reduce Karma or die.
- When you reach 0 Karma Points, you are no longer **Red**{: style="color:red;"}.

### **Reducing PK**
- [**:fontawesome-solid-scroll: Repent Your Sins Quest**](https://lineage2wiki.com/c4/quest/422/repent-your-sins/)
    - When you level up Sin Eater Pet and hand it to [:material-drama-masks: Black Judge](https://lineage2wiki.org/c4/monster/7981/black-judge/), it will reduce your PK points, allowing you to kill again up to a certain point without drop penalty.

> **Tip**: Avoid unnecessary PKing unless you’re prepared for consequences!
