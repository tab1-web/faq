## **How the System Works**

### Explanation

In Lineage 2, combat is between Player vs Environment, (PVE) or Player vs Player (PvP).

When attacking a player while pressing CTRL, or casting good magic on a monster or a Purple Player, your name becomes Purple, which means they can cast de-buffs on you and kill you without becoming a Player Killer.

Most people use “flagged” instead of purple naming.

Player Killers or PK-ers, are who kill a “white” named players and will drop items on death from their inventory or equipment when they have 6 or more PK counts. Other players can attack PKers without becoming Purple or PK.

### **Drop Penalty**
- When you reach a certain PK count, on death you can drop your items while being **Red**{: style="color:red;"}.
    - On Signature, this is 6.
    - On Eternal, this is 5.


### **Reducing Karma**
- Hunt monsters for experience to reduce Karma or die.
- When you reach 0 Karma Points, you are no longer **Red**{: style="color:red;"}.

### **Reducing PK**
- [**:fontawesome-solid-scroll: Repent Your Sins Quest**](https://lineage2wiki.com/c4/quest/422/repent-your-sins/)
    - When you level up Sin Eater Pet and hand it to Black Judge, 
it will reduce your PK points, allowing you to kill again up to a certain point without drop penalty.


> **Tip**: Avoid unnecessary PKing unless you’re prepared for consequences!
