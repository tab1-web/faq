## **Name Colors & Their Meanings**
| Color | Meaning | Consequences |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Normal (White)**{: style="color:white;"} | Neutral (non-aggressive) | No penalties. |
| **Purple**{: style="color:#c154c1;"} | Player has attacked someone (**aggressor**) | Can be attacked without penalty by others. |
| **Red**{: style="color:red;"} | Player has killed someone (**PKer**) | High-risk status, can drop items |

## **How the System Works**
### **Drop Penalty**
- When you reach a certain PK count, on death you can drop your items while being **Red**{: style="color:red;"}.
    - On Signature, this is 6.


### **Reducing Karma**
- Hunt monsters for experience to reduce Karma or die.
- When you reach 0 Karma Points, you are no longer **Red**{: style="color:red;"}.

### **Reducing PK**
- [**:fontawesome-solid-scroll: Repent Your Sins Quest**](https://lineage2wiki.com/c4/quest/422/repent-your-sins/)
    - When you level up Sin Eater Pet and hand it to Black Judge, 
it will reduce your PK points, allowing you to kill again up to a certain point without drop penalty.

> **Tip**: Avoid unnecessary PKing unless youâ€™re prepared for consequences!
