The world of Lineage II is a war-torn land. You have been thrown into this chaos. You have the power

Supports are **essential** as they can give character enhancement "buffs" for a limited time **(~20 minutes)**
therefore highly sentivize group play. The game's balancing system and stats for Monsters are 
adjusted having this in mind.


## :material-fencing: Combat System
In Lineage II, what you see on the screen is in real time. Therefore, it is critical to make an 
appropriate decision quickly for every situation you get in. Lineage II pursues both strategic 
and action-oriented features.

You will battle monsters, players and fight for spots, use skills that need to be selected according
to each particular situation, overcome situations through teamwork with other clan members, and 
experience action that is always thrilling, even when you kill a single monster. 

In *Lineage II*, attacking other players triggers a 
[**color-coded PK system**](https://tab1-web.github.io/faq/Game/General/pk/) that tracks aggression 
and penalties.

## :material-castle: Castle Sieges
Most of the Lords that built castles in the Era of the Giants, still remained and now Kings 
use them as their castles; ancient technologies easily surpasses modern fortification technology.

Other clans who attempt to seize power also want to own a castle. Since the purpose of the many 
clans is to rule the territory according to their ideals, the capturing of the castle is their 
ultimate goal. 

Siege warfare is an innovative PvP combat system. Lineage II's siege warfare has two major goals: 

- Bring out the best player strategies
- Create evolving political drama and excitement. 

Siege warfare can continuously create different strategies, even after several months or 
several years, and will leave you breathless and excited when you stand fully armed with 
your allies in front of the taken castle. 

Numerous privileges are given to the clans who occupy the castle. They impose a tax on the shops 
around the castle, expand the facilities within the castle, manufacture various items, and offer 
the Castle Lord a Wyvern to conquer the sky. There are various systems in which the castle-owning 
clans operate and maintain many public facilities used by other players to make a profit.
