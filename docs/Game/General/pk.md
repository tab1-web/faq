## **Name Colors & Their Meanings**
| Color | Meaning | Consequences |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Normal (White)**{: style="color:white;"} | Neutral (non-aggressive) | No penalties. |
| **Purple**{: style="color:#c154c1;"} | Player has attacked someone (**aggressor**) | Can be attacked without penalty by others. |
| **Red**{: style="color:red;"} | Player has killed someone (**PKer**) | High-risk status, can drop items |

## **How the System Works**
### **1. Initiating an Attack**
- When you attack another player (unprovoked), your name turns **purple**{: style="color:#c154c1;"}.
- The victim can **retaliate** without penalty (their name also turns **purple**{: style="color:#c154c1;"} if they fight back).
- If the victim **does not retaliate**, killing them will turn you **red**{: style="color:red;"}.

### **2. Becoming a PKer (Red Name)**
- Killing **>5 players** (varies by Server) turns your name **red**{: style="color:red;"}.
- **Red players** suffer penalties:
    - **Drop items on death** (high chance to lose equipped gear).
    - **Guards attack on sight** in towns.

### **3. Removing Karma Status**
- **Die repeatedly**: Each death reduces Karma points.
- **Kill monsters**: By earning experience, you can reduce your Karma points

### **4. Reducing PK**
- [**Do the Repent Your Sins Quest**](https://lineage2wiki.com/c4/quest/422/repent-your-sins/): When you level up Sin Eater Pet and hand it to Black Judge, 
it will reduce your PK points, allowing you to kill again up to a certain point without drop penalty.

## **4. Key Mechanics**
- **Self-Defense Rule**: If a **purple**{: style="color:#c154c1;"} player attacks you, killing them **does not** give PK points.
- **Party PKs**: Only the player who lands the killing blow gets PK points.
- **Chaotic Zones**: Some areas (e.g., **Giran Arena**) allow free PvP without penalties (e.g., -EXP).
