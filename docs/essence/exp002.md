### About the test
Given the numerous fake news regarding cooldown breakpoints, I've decided to test it properly and check what values of Cooldown Reduction stat affect the speed of casting Mystic Explosion: Relict skill.

!!! note "Conclusions"

    **The are two important CDR breakpoints:**

    - between -40.04% and -40.64%
    - between -49.44% and -49.95%

    There are some smaller gains between -40.03% and -41.30% as well.

### Methodology
5 minutes each test, autohunt on, single target, attacks are counted by number of spiritshots consumed. Since base Mystic Explosion: Relict outputs two shots, two spiritshots are consumed per attack.

Cooldown Reduction was controlled by modifying enchant levels of various items:

* Venir's Talisman
* Talisman of Baium
* Boots of Evasion
* Frintezza's Necklace
* Beleth's Ring

### Results

| CDR | Shots | Attacks | Time Between Attacks |
|-----:|---:|---:|---: |
|-35.59% | 0760 | 380 | 789ms |
|-38.19% | 0760 | 380 | 789ms |
|-39.53% | 0760 | 380 | 789ms |
|-40.03% | 0760 | 380 | 789ms |
|-40.64% | 0920 | 460 | 652ms |
|-40.74% | 0960 | 480 | 625ms |
|-41.30% | 1012 | 506 | 592ms |
|-42.55% | 1012 | 506 | 592ms |
|-44.27% | 1012 | 506 | 592ms |
|-46.22% | 1012 | 506 | 592ms |
|-48.93% | 1012 | 506 | 592ms |
|-49.44% | 1012 | 506 | 592ms |
|-49.95% | 1202 | 601 | 499ms |
|-51.41% | 1202 | 601 | 499ms |

!!! tip
    This may look like building above 49.95% CDR is worthless - this is true for Mystic Explosion: Relict, however other skills with longer cooldowns still benefit from better CDR stat.
