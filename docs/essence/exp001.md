### About the test
Given the numerous fake news regarding cooldown breakpoints, I've decided to test it properly and check what values of Cooldown Reduction stat affect the speed of casting Triple Shot skill.

!!! note "Conclusions"

    **The most important CDR breakpoint is between -50.33% and -51.33%.** 
    There are some smaller gains in two other steps:

    - between -48.07% and -50.33%
    - between -52.33% and -52.99%

### Methodology
5 minutes each test, autohunt on, single target, attacks are counted by number of soulshots consumed. Since base Triple Shot outputs three shots, three soulshots are consumed per attack.

Cooldown Reduction was controlled by modifying enchant levels of various items:

* Venir's Talisman
* Talisman of Baium
* Boots of Evasion
* Frintezza's Necklace
* Beleth's Ring

### Results

| CDR | Shots | Attacks | Cast Time |
|-----:|---:|---:|---: |
| -43.85% | 1157 | 385 | 779ms |
|-44.90% | 1157 | 385 | 779ms |
|-48.07% | 1157 | 385 | 779ms |
|-50.33% | 1200 | 400 | 750ms |
|-51.33% | 1527 | 509 | 589ms |
|-52.33% | 1527 | 509 | 589ms |
|-52.99% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |
|-53.47% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |
|-54.39% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |
|-56.38% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |
|-58.18% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |
|-59.08% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |
|-60.43% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |
|-64.38% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |
|-67.52% | 1593 | 531 | 564ms |

!!! tip
    This may look like building above 53% CDR is worthless - this is true for Triple Shot, however other skills with longer cooldowns still benefit from better CDR stat.
