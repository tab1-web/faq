### About the test
Given the numerous fake news regarding cooldown breakpoints, I've decided to test it properly and check what values of Cooldown Reduction stat affect the speed of casting Essential Fatal Crush skill.

!!! note "Conclusions"

    **The key CDR breakpoint is between -49.31% and -49.82%**

    There are a few more breakpoints as well, most notably from -39.25% to -40.58% and then again to -41.18%.


### Methodology
5 minutes each test, autohunt on, single target, attacks are counted by number of soulshots consumed. Essential Fatal Counter consumes two soulshots per attack, regardless of target HP.

Cooldown Reduction was controlled by modifying enchant levels of various items:

* Venir's Talisman
* Talisman of Baium
* Boots of Evasion
* Frintezza's Necklace
* Beleth's Ring

### Results

| CDR | Shots | Attacks | Cast Time |
|-----:|---:|---:|---: |
|-17.84% | 0608 | 304 | 986ms |
|-21.90% | 0762 | 381 | 787ms |
|-26.73% | 0762 | 381 | 787ms |
|-31.56% | 0762 | 381 | 787ms |
|-39.25% | 0762 | 381 | 787ms |
|-40.58% | 0868 | 434 | 691ms |
|-41.18% | 1014 | 504 | 595ms |
|-42.39% | 1014 | 504 | 595ms |
|-49.31% | 1018 | 509 | 589ms |
|-49.82% | 1184 | 592 | 506ms |
|-50.04% | 1204 | 602 | 498ms |
|-52.66% | 1204 | 602 | 498ms |

!!! tip
    This may look like building above 49.95% CDR is worthless - this is true for Essential Fatal Crush, however other skills with longer cooldowns still benefit from better CDR stat.
