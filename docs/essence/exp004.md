### About the test
Spamming key presses is a staple of PvP in Lineage 2 - but is it fast? And does it utilise class to the best of it's ability?

!!! note "Conclusions"

    **Physical key presses are not matching the best of autohunt speeds - this of course affects PvP the most. In the case of Triple Shot, spamming typically runs at 670ms per attack, where autohunt can go down to 570ms per attack .**

    It is unclear whether this is due to lack of input buffering or some other reason at the moment.


### Methodology
5 minutes each test, autohunt off, single target, attacks are counted by number of soulshots consumed. Triple Shot consumes three soulshots per attack, regardless of target HP.

*Note that the last test was done the next day, Triple Shot was corrected to consume 2 soulshots.*

Cooldown Reduction was set past the final breakpoint (maximum reduction). See [Experimentarium #001 - Triple Shot Cooldown Reduction](https://tab1-web.github.io/faq/essence/exp001/){ data-preview } for more information.

Key presses were controlled with Razer Synapse macro to repeat key presses every X miliseconds. We can then do tests with different speeds at which keys are pressed.

In the last test, I have also recorded my actual key spamming for about 15 seconds, then ran this in loop to simulate 5 minutes of manual spamming the skill.

These key presses can then be compared to how quickly attacks are done by autohunt - as seen in [Experimentarium #001](https://tab1-web.github.io/faq/essence/exp001/){ data-preview } .
