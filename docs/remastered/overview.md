# Reborn: Remastered

A **modern interpretation of Lineage II**, built on years of experience and redesigned for the **2026 playstyle.**

The server is fully refreshed of the game’s core systems to ensure you stay competitive without the 16-hour daily grind.

## The Concept

Remastered follows a **Progressive Chapter System** (one chapter per month), evolving from C1 to H5 with curated modern imports. It is designed as a yearly experience: a main persistent server plus a fresh start every year.

- **Classic H5 Base:** Humans, Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, and Kamaels fully rebalanced and enhanced.
- **Idle Progress:** Limited auto-hunt instances for background progress, ensuring you don't fall behind while AFK.
- **Modern Dungeons:** Meaningful PvE with automated matching and queues.
- **Personal Housing:** Your own instanced zone with NPCs and decorations that contribute to your progression.
- **Competitive PvP:** Redesigned Olympiad and PvP Epic Boss instances, no NPC click-races, just skill.

## Modernized Mechanics

**This is not Essence.** The core formulas and class tree remain traditional H5. While we’ve removed the "ultra-boring" grind, active play is still rewarded:

- **Manual World:** The open world is for active players; auto-hunt is restricted to specific instances.
- **Crafting:** Gear still requires gathering recipes, materials, and completing quests.
- **Active War:** All major content (Raids, Epics, Olympiad, Sieges) is fully manual.
- **Accessible Epics:** Small-group challenges provide alternative paths to epic jewels traditionally locked behind massive alliances.

Whether you enjoy solo grinding, fishing, or organized GvG, Remastered offers a comfortable but long-term journey. With basic buffs, mana potions, and vitality systems, you are never "stuck" in one stage for months.
