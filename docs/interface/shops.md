# Shops Info

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ### What's an Offline Shop?

    - An Offline Shop allows you to sell items in a peace zone while your game client is closed.

    - To activate it, set up your private shop and type `.offline` in the chat.

    - You can farm on one character while your **offline** shop runs on a separate account.

- ### Having Trouble?

    - On Signature if you made sure you have only one offline shop and it is level 20, log into all of your accounts.

    - On Forever H5 you can only have maximum of 2 offline shops. 

    - On Eternal you can have more than 2.
