## Meta Classes

Below you'll find descriptions of all major meta classes, categorized by role. Each class includes key traits to help guide your choice based on playstyle and leveling experience.

Other classes that I haven't mentioned are not here because I think they have niche uses or I wouldn't recommend them to a new player.
