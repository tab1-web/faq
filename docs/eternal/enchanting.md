- ### Enchanting Skills

    In `ALT + K` drag the skill to **Standard Skills** in the Enchanting Window.

    Make sure you are 3rd class and have enough EXP/SP.

    **Press Enchant Skill** after you selected the Enchant Option.

    > If you still cannot enchant, after everything checked, have the skill enchant window open, go to Maria and teleport to a Town, it will allow you to enchant. Maybe client repair fixes the issue.
