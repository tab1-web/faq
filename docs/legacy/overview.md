# Reborn: Legacy

Legacy is a long-term, old-school project following the official update schedule from **Chronicle 1 to High Five**. 

This is a **7-year journey** designed to recreate the authentic Lineage II experience as it was meant to be played.

With the spirit of *Origins* and *Signature*, Legacy offers retail-close content on a modern, stable client. This is the definitive home for mature, long-term players who value the purity of the game.

## Nostalgic Experience

To preserve the social fabric of the game and eliminate the "min-max" culture that ruined the classic experience, Legacy implements strict rules:

- **Subscription Based:** A fair sub-model replaces the need for **premium shops**, **custom cosmetics**, or **"pay-to-skip"** services.
    - **3.70€** with yearly balance promotion, **7.40€/month** from yearly subscription or **14€/month** for the basic subscription
- **True Single-Box:** No dual-boxing and no account sharing. One player, one character, one world.
- **Modern Quality of Life:** While the content is old-school, the interface is not. Enjoy auto-soulshots and a modern mailing system without the critical errors of the 2004 client.
- **Zero-Tolerance for "Drivers":** A system designed to kill the 24/7 "Driver" meta. L2 is a game, not a job.
- **Removing MDT as an offline shop gathering area:** Cities will feel more lively.
- **Removing buffers on relog:** Buffers on relog will be prevented, it won't be possible for example to have PP / SE / EE on relog played by 1 person.
- **Removing Retail Bugs:** All kinds of retail bugs (like Healing Cubic healing across the map) will be fixed and won't exist.

## Anti-Powerleveling & Security

We have implemented technical measures to ensure a level playing field where solo players can still co-exist with the community:

- **Adding to our rules the usage of drivers**, hired drivers or the min-max CP structure is not allowed (large amount of people playing in one party), such as any attempt to bypass the system.
- **HWID Locking:** Only 1 device can log an account every 24 hours. A maximum of 3 unique devices can log an account within a 30-day window.
    - This means you can play from home, work or during a trip, but only once device a day.
- **Fatigue System:** To prevent 24/7 account exploitation, power levelling the rates for XP, SP, Adena, Drops decrease drastically after extended daily playtime. 
    - This system can be for account or character, maybe initially character.
    - Details will come later if its an inverse vitality system where you get less experience as you get experience.
- **Active Moderation:** Manual GM inspections and pattern recognition to eliminate "hired drivers".
- **The "Anti-CP" Philosophy:** Success is driven by socialization and clan unity, not by rotating 20 people onto a single party to dominate a server.

This set of measures will provide a healthy server, a healthy community and a social experience.

## Mechanics & Progression

Legacy stays true to the vanilla spirit while making quality-of-life improvements to the problematic 20-year-old design flaws:

- **Chapter Progression:** Starting at C1, the game evolves naturally. Balance issues that is game breaking, like Destroyer or Pole-farming won't work by retail. On Signature, Sleep for example was tuned, you can expect similar things on Legacy.
    - Plan is not to remaster old chronicles, Chronicles will be released mostly Vanilla, a server oriented for old-school players.
- **Economy & Shops:** Offline shops are supported. Yearly subscribers receive a dedicated secondary account specifically for offline trading.
- **No Sub to Main feature:** It is known that server will evolve from C1 to H5, so plan accordingly.

After Legacy, our server stack is complete. No new servers, just a permanent, evolving home for the community.

There are other things worth mentioning, It is better to wait for us to make an stream/podcast where we will explain the server concept and all its features. (No date known, wait)
