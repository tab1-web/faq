The <code>-t</code> makes it run continuously.</li> <li>Let it run for 30-60 seconds, then press Ctrl+C to stop it.</li> <li>Interpret the results:<ul> <li>Good Connection: Consistent, low latency (e.g., 20-80ms) with no \"Request timed out\" messages.</li> <li>Bad Connection/Damaged Route: You will see high latency (e.g., 200ms+), \"Request timed out\" messages, or high \"Packet loss\" percentage. This confirms packet loss is happening.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Step 3: Trace the Route (<code>tracert</code>)</p> <p>This shows you where on the path the problem occurs.</p> <ol> <li>In Command Prompt, type <code>tracert [Server IP]</code> (for example, <code>tracert 878.222.767</code>).</li> <li>The command will list every \"hop\" (router) your data takes to the server.</li> <li>Interpret the results: Look for a hop where the latency suddenly jumps very high (e.g., from 40ms to 300ms) or starts showing asterisks <code>* * *</code> (meaning timeouts).
